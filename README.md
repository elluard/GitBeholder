# GitBeholder

GitBeholder is a modern Git backend designed to simplify and enhance your workflow. Built with an Elixir Phoenix and a separate frontend application (*it comes as soon as possible*), it allows users to perform key Git operations like ``commits``, ``pushes``, ``viewing diffs``, exploring ``commit history``, and more â€” all through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Visual Git history navigation
- Create and manage commits
- Push to remote repositories
- View commit details (`git show fd2ec6d62ef7e8c1c2ecd437b1a305439815b372`)
- Inline and side-by-side file diffs (`git diff`)
- File change tracking
- Interactive staging and unstaging

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Elixir and Phoenix
- **Frontend:** It will be build as soon as possible in React/Electron.
